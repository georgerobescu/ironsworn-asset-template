# ironsworn-asset-template

Hi! I'm not sure what the point of this little app is... It's sort of fun to
rapidly-prototype assets with it. Being able to export useable assets would be the
eventual goal, I suppose. Hopefully one day this will lower the bar for folks less
familiar with design software to create their own semi-polished assets.

Feel free to contribute or suggest changes!
